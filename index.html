            <p class="paragraph">&ltp&gt<span class="lightest-blue">Hey y'all! I'm Mikaela, and I love learning how to make things pretty. My background in design started with graphics, then I veered towards illustration, then I was asked to build a website, and my ambitious self thought, "Sure! I'll just do it from scratch because I hate the overuse of website builder templates"</span>&lt/p&gt</p>

            <p class="paragraph">&ltp&gt<span class="lightest-blue">I logged into my favorite trusty resource: Reddit, found some communities that seemed related to what I was trying to accomplish, scoured different threads about the best way to build a completely customized website, and after initially trying the easy way out with Webflow and *sigh* Elementor, I realized that maybe just maybe I'm going to have to learn a thing or two about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the lofty ideas I had for this project.</span>&lt/p&gt</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">&ltp&gt<span class="lightest-blue">Fun fact: there are many spirited Reddit debates about the best resources to learn web development. I started with freeCodeCamp but then I realized as I was flying through the modules I wasn't really hanging on to the concepts. So I went back to Reddit to find another way, and that's when I learned about The Odin Project. I liked The Odin Project because of its thoroughness, and I liked freeCodeCamp because I was able to implement the concepts I was learning immediately.</span>&lt/p&gt</p> 

            <p class="paragraph">&ltp&gt<span class="lightest-blue">So I'm doing both, and that's where I am today. I created this site to finish my Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp then I'll jump right into JavaScript. I can't wait to make my sites more functional and have all the cool transitions I envision in my head.</span>&lt/p&gt</p>

            <p>&ltp&gt<span class="lightest-blue">When I first started reading about how to learn web development, the one piece of advise I heard constantly was to do projects. You can read all the videos in the world and watch all of the tutorials on YouTube, but if you're not creating something while you're learning, chances are, you aren't learning as efficiently as possible.</span>&lt/p&gt</p>
